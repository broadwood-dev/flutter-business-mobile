# flutter-business-mobile

To run: target main.dart inside `flutter_business_mobile/lib` using Android Studio or run `flutter run lib/main.dart` inside the `flutter_business_mobile` folder.

NOTE: iOS has not been tested. Results may vary (as I don't own a Mac)

To rebuild the JsonSerializable classes, cd into `/flutter_business_mobile` and run `flutter pub run build_runner build`
